Compress the String

Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
Example:
If a string has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".

The string is compressed only when the repeated character count is more than 1.
Note:
Consecutive count of every character in the input string is less than or equal to 9.
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.
Output Format:
The output contains the string after compression printed in single line.
Note:
You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6

Where 'N' is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 sec
