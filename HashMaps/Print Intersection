Print Intersection

You have been given two integer arrays/lists (ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively.
You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain
a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Note :
Input arrays/lists can contain duplicate elements.
The intersection elements printed would be in the order they appear in the second array/list (ARR2).

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.
The second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first the array/list.
The third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.
The fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.

Output format :
Print the intersection elements. Each element is printed in a separate line.

                // and also decrease the frequency by 1
                if(frequency > 0) {
                    System.out.println(arr2[i]+" ");
